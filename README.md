## What is GitHub Actions?
Enables you to create custom software development life cycle (SDLC) workflows directly in our GitHub repository.

- Fully integrated into Github. (Doesnâ€™t require any external site)
- Provides multiple templates for CI and one can create own custom action and publish on the [Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions).
- Completely free for every open-source repository and include 2000 free build minutes per month for all private repositories.

## Creating a workflow file
1. At the root of your repository, create a directory named ` .github/workflows ` to store your workflow files.
2. In ` .github/workflows `, add a `.yml ` or `.yaml ` file for your workflow.
3. Use the "Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions" reference documentation to choose events to trigger an action, add actions, and customize your workflow.
